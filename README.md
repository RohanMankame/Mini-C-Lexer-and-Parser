# Mini-C-Lexer-and-Parser
This repository contains a foundational project for a compiler front-end, developed as a class assignment. It focuses on the lexical analysis (tokenizing) and parsing phases for a simplified C-like language, often referred to as "Mini-C."

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to implement a lexer and a basic parser capable of processing Mini-C source code. The lexer breaks down the raw source into a stream of meaningful tokens, while the parser then processes this token stream, performs syntactic analysis, and builds a symbol table to manage identifiers and their types.

The current implementation outputs the recognized tokens along with their attributes, line numbers, and column numbers, demonstrating the successful tokenization and initial stages of parsing.

Features
Lexical Analysis: Converts Mini-C source code into a stream of tokens (e.g., keywords, identifiers, operators, integer/float literals).

Token Recognition: Identifies various Mini-C language constructs such as FUNC, VAR, INT, BOOL, FLOAT, VOID, IF, ELSE, WHILE, RETURN, BREAK, CONTINUE, PRINT, STRUCT, SIZE, NEW, LPAREN, RPAREN, LBRACKET, RBRACKET, SEMI, COMMA, DOT, ADDR, VALUE, ASSIGN, TYPEOF, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, and, or, not), and relational operators (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=).

Symbol Table Integration: Demonstrates the creation of new symbol table entities for identifiers during the lexical/parsing process.

Error Handling: Includes basic lexical error detection for unexpected characters.

Line and Column Tracking: Provides precise location information for each token.

How it Works
The project utilizes JFlex for lexical analysis and custom Java classes for parsing and overall compilation flow.

Lexer.jflex (JFlex specification): Defines the regular expressions and rules for recognizing tokens in Mini-C. JFlex generates Lexer.java from this file.

Lexer.java (Generated): The actual lexical analyzer, responsible for reading input characters and producing tokens.

Parser.java: Consumes the token stream from the Lexer. It defines token constants and includes the yyparse() method which drives the token processing and prints token information.

ParserVal.java: A utility class used to hold the semantic values (attributes) associated with the recognized tokens (e.g., the integer value of an INT_LIT token).

Compiler.java: The orchestrator class that initializes the Parser and initiates the parsing process.

Program.java: The main entry point of the application. It reads the Mini-C source file and passes it to the Compiler.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

JFlex 1.6.1 (or compatible version)

Building the Project
Navigate to the src directory:

cd proj2-minic-lexer/src


Copy JFlex JAR:
Ensure jflex-1.6.1.jar is present in the src directory. If not, download it and place it there.

Compile the Lexer using JFlex:

java -jar jflex-1.6.1.jar Lexer.flex


This command will generate Lexer.java in the src directory.

Compile all Java files:

javac *.java


Running the Program
From the src directory, execute the Program class, providing a Mini-C source file as an argument.
For example, using test/solu1.txt as input (you may need to adjust the path depending on where you run it from):

java Program ../test/solu1.txt


To capture the output to a file (recommended for analysis):

java Program ../test/solu1.txt > output.txt


Example Output
When running the program with a sample Mini-C file, the output will detail the recognized tokens, their attributes, and their position in the source code.

Input (e.g., test/solu1.txt):

FUNC main()
BEGIN
    VAR a BOOL;
    a := 1;
    PRINT a;
END


Partial Output (similar to solu1.txt):

<FUNC, 1:1> <<new symbol table entity [0, "main"]>><ID, attr:sym-id:0, 1:6><TYPEOF, 1:10><INT, 1:12><LPAREN, 1:15><RPAREN, 1:16>
<BEGIN, 2:1>
    <VAR, 3:5> <<new symbol table entity [1, "a"]>><ID, attr:sym-id:1, 3:9><TYPEOF, 3:10><BOOL, 3:12><SEMI, 3:16>
    <ID, attr:sym-id:1, 4:5> <ASSIGN, 4:7> <INT_VALUE, attr:"1", 4:10><SEMI, 4:11>
    <PRINT, 5:5> <ID, attr:sym-id:1, 5:11><SEMI, 5:12>
<END, 6:1>
Success!
